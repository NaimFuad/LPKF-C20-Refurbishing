# LPKF-C20-Refurbishing

The main idea behind this project is to refurbish LPKF Protomat C20 PCB milling machine with open source hardware, firmware and software.

TThe LPKF C20 machine is a PCB milling machine that creates a PCB board by milling the contour based from the PCB design. We bought this machine in 2005 and the machine has stop functioning due to faulty at controller board.

Since the machine is a close-sourced machine, the only way to repurpose the machine is to make use of the existing hardware and replacing the board controller.

The thought process behind this project was recorded through this report from understanding how the main PCB board controller works , rectifiying what is the problems and how to rebuild the machine controller from scratch.

Repairing the main board by replacing the IC should be a piece of cake but the only problem arises from the software since it is outdated and also based on license. All hardware , software and firmware of he newly refurbished board was from open source community that are free to download and esily available on the market.

Refer to the Report for full information.
